I’m currently working as an SDE at [Gen Digital Inc](https://www.gendigital.com/), a leading security-focused product company, where I’m embracing the journey of being a generalist 🌍 and exploring new horizons 🚀. 

I love tearing down products to understand how different minds approach problems—it's fascinating to see how we all perceive things in unique ways.

Exploration is at the heart ❤️ of what I do, constantly pushing me to grow 🌱 both as a [person](https://www.instagram.com/ramachandran_1103) and a [professional](https://www.linkedin.com/in/a-ramachandran/). Whether it’s diving deep into tech, product design, or anything in between, I’m all about learning, improving, and enjoying a good cup of coffee ☕.

You can catch me speaking or attending conferences on Web3, tech, and product design.
