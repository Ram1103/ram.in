I’m currently working as an SDE at [Gen Digital Inc](https://www.gendigital.com/), a leading security-focused product company, where I’m embracing the journey of being a generalist 🌍 and exploring new horizons 🚀. I love tearing down products to understand how different minds approach problems—it's fascinating to see how we all perceive things in unique ways.

Exploration is at the heart ❤️ of what I do, constantly pushing me to grow 🌱 both as a person and a professional. Whether it’s diving deep into tech, product design, or anything in between, I’m all about learning and improving.

You can catch me speaking or attending conferences on Web3, tech, and product design.
